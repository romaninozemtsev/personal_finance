### Why digital receipts

1. understand your spendings at the item level. As you analyze your monthly statement,
you might want to jump into the particular purchase receipt and see what you actually bought.
2. easier to return (for example you can return with target digital receipt, instead of keeping a paper receipt for 30 days).
3. you can find exact names of things you liked. E.g you really liked that white whine you bought 2 months ago, but forgot the name.


### Places that offer digital receipts.

1. all online merchants like Amazon, Anthropologie etc
2. target, if you sign up for their reward program and type your phone number every time at checkout https://circle.target.com/
3. instacart - it's obviously digital as it's online order; but that's huge benefit - you always know how much you spend an on what.
and you can always find items you bought before and buy it again.
4. CSV - TBD to test.
5. any place that offers square might have it. as digital receipts is part of their platform. TBD to test it.
Unfortunately Square is rarely used by department stores or groceries where you need itemized receipts the most.
